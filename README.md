BayMax, an Android app that uses a mobile phone's in-built sensors(accelerometer, GPS) to detect a crash and send an SMS to user's emergency contacts, all in background. The app automatically gets triggered once it detects that the user in motion and continues running in background throughout the journey. The algorithms used minimize the triggering of any false alarms.
